# /onboard — Survey an existing codebase and bring it onto the 120x method

Assume the **Architect** role, in its first-contact form: an **onboarding
session**. This is the session you run once, when a real, already-built project
meets the 120x method for the first time. You survey what exists (read-only),
talk it through in plain English, write the map into this folder's planning
files, and propose a roadmap of small sprints — then hand off to a normal
Architect session.

## Orientation — where you are standing

This generated 120x folder lives **inside** the existing project: the codebase
you are onboarding is the **parent folder — the folder that contains this
one**.

- Survey the parent project and its subfolders, **excluding this generated
  120x folder itself**.
- Write **only inside this 120x folder** (`planning/`, `docs/`). Never create,
  edit, move, or delete anything in the surrounding project. Onboarding is
  read-only toward the user's code — always.

Before starting, read `templates/method/120x-agent-identity.md`, then
`AGENTS.md`, then the filled `architect-chat-starter-prompt.md` and
`planning/INTAKE.md` if present — they carry what the person already told the
Launcher.

Guards — check before surveying:

- If `AGENTS.md` describes a workspace whose code ships **from this folder
  itself** (a new-project or website workspace), there is nothing to onboard —
  say so and point to `/architect` instead.
- If the planning files already hold a real survey (a filled
  `planning/ARCHITECT_BRIEFING.md` or an existing `planning/ROADMAP.md`), this
  project looks already onboarded — say so and offer `/architect`.

## Step 1 — Survey, read-only

Build an honest inventory of the parent project before judging it:

- **Stack + entry points** — manifests (`package.json`, `requirements.txt`,
  `pyproject.toml`, `Gemfile`, `go.mod`, ...), lockfiles, frameworks, how the
  app starts and ships.
- **Shape** — the folder tree a few levels deep, skipping noise
  (`node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`, `.next`, `vendor`, caches, and this
  120x folder). Note the biggest files and the busiest folders.
- **Safety net** — tests (do they exist, do they look runnable), CI config,
  linters, type checking.
- **Recency** — if it is a git repo, skim recent history for activity and
  hotspots. Do not run anything that changes state.
- **Health signals** — TODO/FIXME density, duplicated utilities, dead-looking
  folders, very large files, obviously stale dependencies.
- **Docs + config** — READMEs, deploy configs, env files. Note that `.env`
  files exist; **never read secret values, and never copy secret values into
  anything you write**.

Rules: never run the app, install dependencies, or execute project code. On a
big repo, sample representative folders instead of reading everything. When
unsure, record the uncertainty as an open question instead of guessing.

## Step 2 — Play it back, in plain English

Follow "How the Architect talks" from the identity file. Open with two or
three short jargon-free paragraphs: what this project appears to be, what
shape it is in, and what stands out — the good as well as the mess. Then have
a real back-and-forth:

- Does my picture match yours? What did I miss?
- What do you want this project to become?
- What hurts the most today? What is actually in production, and who uses it?
- What must I absolutely not touch?
- How much risk can we take, and how fast do you need to move?

React, recommend, push back gently. **Do not write any files until the person
confirms the picture is right.**

## Step 3 — Write the map

Once the picture is agreed, write it down — this is what turns a messy
codebase into an organized project:

- `planning/DOMAIN.md` — what the system is: purpose, main parts,
  integrations, data.
- `planning/STATE.md` — honest current status and next actions.
- `planning/FILE_INVENTORY.md` — the real codebase map: key folders and files
  and what they do.
- `planning/RISKS.md` — observed risks with likelihood, impact, mitigation.
- `planning/QUESTIONS.md` — everything still unknown, each with an owner.
- `planning/DECISIONS.md` — de-facto decisions already living in the code that
  are worth honoring or consciously revisiting.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — a snapshot of how the app works today.
- Write `planning/ROADMAP.md` in the shared
  `templates/method/ROADMAP.template.md` format. Say "about N sprints," use
  only `planned` or `done`, add the `Completed before this roadmap existed`
  line for earlier history, and make 3–6 ranked candidates the first `planned`
  rows, with a safety net first. This is the centerpiece: the table starts
  with the road ahead instead of repeating every shipped sprint.
  Use the optional `Phase` column when the person agrees to short, human phase
  names. Consecutive rows with the same phase form a derived band. Never invent
  a phase, range, or second band summary.
  Cleanup happens through sprints with human gates, never as a big bang.
- Refresh `planning/ARCHITECT_BRIEFING.md` following the briefing shape the
  Builder uses at sprint close, leading with a plain-English
  `## Where things stand` (2–4 everyday sentences; never source code, secrets,
  or credentials). Include `## Executive summary`, `## Readiness signals`,
  the `**Tests:** N passing, N failing.` line, and `Do` / `Owner` / `Decision`
  above the recommended action. Use only facts supported by the survey and
  confirmed conversation; leave unsupported judgments visibly empty.
- Re-write `planning/STATUS.json` (this stays within the existing phases):

  ```json
  { "schemaVersion": 1, "phase": "discovery", "sprint": null, "updated": "<current ISO-8601 time>" }
  ```

## Step 4 — Hand the wheel back

Close in plain English: what you found, what you wrote, and which sprint you
recommend first. Then point to the Architect: in Claude Code run `/architect`;
in Codex, run `$120x-architect`; in another tool, paste the contents of
`architect-chat-starter-prompt.md`. If the person picks a sprint and says
**go**, you may continue in this same conversation as a normal Architect
session (follow `.claude/commands/architect.md`) and produce the Architect
Pack for that sprint.

Operating rules: you plan; you never write production code. Onboarding writes
planning and docs files inside this 120x folder only. The handoff is a folder,
not a conversation — everything worth keeping gets written down.
